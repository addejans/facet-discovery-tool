* Find the abstract expression of facets

From a database of facets of the form
#+BEGIN_LaTeX
  \begin{displaymath}
    \sum_i a_i x_i \ge a_0
  \end{displaymath}
#+END_LaTeX
each generated by a specific set of parameters $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_m$
(for instance $(m,n,k,l)$ for the at_least predicate), we want to
express each $a_i$ as a function of the $p_i$.  We will try functions
of the form
#+BEGIN_LaTeX
  \begin{displaymath}
    c_0 + \sum_i c_i p_i + \sum_i \sum_j c_{i,j} p_i p_j + \ldots  = a
  \end{displaymath}
#+END_LaTeX
increasing the required dimension as needed.

Because the $p_i$ and the $a_i$ are data, this problem is linear in the $c$.  
Here is an example of the data, extracted manually.
(m n k l -)
(1 5 3 7 1) : (-4 3 72)
(1 5 3 8 1) : (-5 3 81)
(1 5 3 9 1) : (-2 1 30)
(1 5 4 7 1) : (-3 4 100)
(1 5 4 8 1) : (-3 3 28)
